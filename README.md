## Description

This is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for OneTask, a progressive web app designed to revolutionize hiring through gamified skill challenges. The MVP is built to be completely free to run for at least one year, leveraging client-side storage and free-tier services.

# OneTask Project

**OneTask** is a unique recruitment platform designed to simplify and gamify the hiring process.

## ðŸ”¥ What Is OneTask?

OneTask connects people to work together without requiring interviews. Instead, recruiters post tasks with specific timeframes. Applicants complete these tasks to showcase their skills. The one who performs best wins the job â€” it's a skill-based recommendation game that replaces resumes and long application processes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Task-Based Hiring**: No need for interviews â€” just assign a task and let the best performer earn the opportunity.
- **Gamified Skill Showcases**: Applicants prove their value by completing challenges, not writing complex text or rÃ©sumÃ©s.
- **Custom Recruiter Games**: Recruiters can design multi-stage challenges to evaluate applicants in a fun and transparent way.
- **Clear Reward System**: Applicants see how many stages are in the process and when they'll be rewarded.
- **Trust & Reputation System**: Applicants earn stars from different companies. These stars represent their track record and help build trust.
- **Subscription-Based Model**: Recruiters receive a limited number of stars depending on their plan â€” making star allocation meaningful and strategic.
- **Cross-Company Reputation**: Applicants can carry their stars across the platform to gain credibility across companies.

## ðŸ’¸ Licensing

This software is **not open-source**. It is licensed **privately** to allow rental access to companies. Revenue is generated through:

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription models.
- Commissions earned from successful hires.
- Licensing OneTask as a branded hiring solution for organizations.

> **Note**: Companies must agree to the private license terms before using the OneTask platform.

## ðŸš€ Business Vision

OneTask envisions a world where getting a job feels like playing a fair game â€” merit-based, transparent, and dynamic. We want to help applicants shine and recruiters discover real talent without bias or unnecessary complexity.
